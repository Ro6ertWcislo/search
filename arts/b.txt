In linear algebra, the singular-value decomposition (SVD) is a factorization of a real or complex matrix. It is the generalization of the eigendecomposition of a positive semidefinite normal matrix (for example, a symmetric matrix with positive eigenvalues) to any {\displaystyle m\times n} m\times n matrix via an extension of the polar decomposition. It has many useful applications in signal processing and statistics.

Formally, the singular-value decomposition of an {\displaystyle m\times n} m\times n real or complex matrix {\displaystyle \mathbf {M} } \mathbf {M}  is a factorization of the form {\displaystyle \mathbf {U\Sigma V^{*}} } {\displaystyle \mathbf {U\Sigma V^{*}} }, where {\displaystyle \mathbf {U} } \mathbf {U}  is an {\displaystyle m\times m} m\times m real or complex unitary matrix, {\displaystyle \mathbf {\Sigma } } \mathbf{\Sigma} is a {\displaystyle m\times n} m\times n rectangular diagonal matrix with non-negative real numbers on the diagonal, and {\displaystyle \mathbf {V} } \mathbf {V}  is an {\displaystyle n\times n} n\times n real or complex unitary matrix. The diagonal entries {\displaystyle \sigma _{i}} \sigma _{i} of {\displaystyle \mathbf {\Sigma } } \mathbf{\Sigma} are known as the singular values of {\displaystyle \mathbf {M} } \mathbf {M} . The columns of {\displaystyle \mathbf {U} } \mathbf {U}  and the columns of {\displaystyle \mathbf {V} } \mathbf {V}  are called the left-singular vectors and right-singular vectors of {\displaystyle \mathbf {M} } \mathbf {M} , respectively.
