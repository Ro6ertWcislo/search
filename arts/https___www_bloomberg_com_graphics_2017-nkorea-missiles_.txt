Wednesday’s test of a new missile that could reach any American city brings leader Kim Jong Un closer than ever to acquiring an effective nuclear deterrent. North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test Sept. 3 and U.S. defense analysts now believe Kim has as many as 60 nuclear bombs.

While Kim declared after the launch of the new Hwasong-15 rocket that the country had “finally realized the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force,” several hurdles remain. Building a reliable arsenal of intercontinental ballistic missiles also requires miniaturizing warheads, returning them safely through the atmosphere and guiding them to their targets.

Kim has remained defiant, firing missiles over Japan into the Pacific Ocean. He has threatened to conduct an atmospheric nuclear test and fire missiles near Guam, home to some of the most important U.S. military bases in the region.

While Kim’s regime has made steady progress, the U.S. and South Korea assess that its ballistic missiles still couldn’t survive the stress of re-entering the atmosphere or target specific locations.

China and Russia, two countries that Trump has singled out for supporting North Korea, have backed stricter United Nations sanctions against Kim while also saying they prefer dialogue and oppose regime change.
