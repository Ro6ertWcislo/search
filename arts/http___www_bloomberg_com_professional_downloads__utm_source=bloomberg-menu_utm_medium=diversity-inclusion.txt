The update introduced issues that are known to interfere with the Bloomberg Terminal. Please avoid updating your PCs to the affected versions. Bloomberg has worked with Microsoft to investigate and resolve these issues. On November 14, 2017, Microsoft released a patch for Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (OS build: 16299.64) which addresses one of the known issues. Please see the Microsoft Support article for more details. To check your current Windows version, select the ‘Start’ button, then select ‘Settings’ > ‘System’ > ‘About’. If you are currently running one of the affected versions, please contact your IT support or Bloomberg Tech support for assistance with rolling back to your previous Windows 10 version or updating to the latest Windows 10 version.   Bloomberg Professional Service Ending Support for Microsoft Office 2007 As of January 1, 2018, Bloomberg will no longer officially support Microsoft Office 2007. However, Bloomberg will take commercially reasonable steps to assist customers with compatibility issues until April 30, 2018. Customers who do not migrate to a newer version of Microsoft Office by April 2018 will stop receiving any new updates for the Bloomberg Add-In. Between January and April of 2018, Bloomberg will take commercially reasonable steps to ensure that the April version of the Bloomberg Add-In is stable for customers who choose to remain on Office 2007.
